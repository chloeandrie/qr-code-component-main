## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When first learning CSS, I immediately jumped to Flexbox and Grid to create responsive layouts. Starting this challenge, I focused on working with the browser's natural responsiveness - not fighting it with lots of wrappers, containers, flexbox, grid, and/or media queries. I think I got pretty close on my first Frontend Mentor Challenge.

### Continued development

I'm so excited to become a more efficient, effective web developer. Looking forward to more challenges and fun projects!

## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Feedback from Frontend Mentor suggested that I use flexbox to center the QR card, instead of using margin.

I also checked the accessibility errors and took a try at correcting those like including an h1.

And I noticed small differences between mine and the original design (e.g., adding a box-shadow).

### Continued development

I'm so excited to become a more efficient, effective web developer. Looking forward to more challenges and fun projects!
